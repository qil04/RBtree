[Good Project. Upon Zybook and Onsay's Lecture, have a deeper understanding of Black_Red Tree's rotation, insertion, remove, and rebalanced of BRT property. Although this is very complex project, but I really appreciate piazza's help. In the last function, the minor problem is that I use if, sub-if, else before, but the correct is if...and..., else, because I use sub_if, if condition was passed and return true, sub_if was not passed and return false, it will never go onto else. Although it is a logic minor error, but when I found that I am really delighted.]
